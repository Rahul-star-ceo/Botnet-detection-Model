# Botnet-detection-Model

Abstract
Botnets are a major cybersecurity threat, executing attacks through compromised devices. This project introduces a machine learning approach to detect botnets using structural learning and inference techniques. Using the CSE-CICIDS2018 dataset, our model accurately identifies botnet activities by analyzing behavior and network interactions. This method enhances detection accuracy and reduces false positives, improving botnet detection reliability without extensive labeled data.

Introduction
Our project "Botnet Detection Model Using Machine Learning with Bayesian Networks" enhances cybersecurity by identifying botnet attacks using Bayesian Networks with Hill Climbing for structural learning, Maximum Likelihood Estimator for parameter estimation, and Variable Elimination for inference. This advanced approach provides real-time botnet detection, strengthening network security and mitigating cyber threats.
